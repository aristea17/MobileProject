<p align="center">This application was build for the Internet & Mobile Project 2014/2015 course at the Faculty of Computer Science
in the Free University of Bolzano.
Its purpose is to facilitate the hotel's work in managing product stock and supplies orders.
In doing this project, we were helped by people working in this industry for collecting experiences and data.
Unfortunately, our application has not been tested yet from them because it is missing some key feature like
perishability of products and difference on products based on season and the ability to add remove entries in DB
 like suppliers and products.</p>
